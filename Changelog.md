Veldman's Hints (from 28 March 2023)
  ASD has been prevalent for a long time, but individuals diagnosed with this condition still have trouble functioning as independent members of society. The introduction of sign language as a mainstream option for  communication, rather than communication restricted to the deaf and hard of hearing community, would greatly contribute to making individuals with ASD independent members of society.
  Further goals:
    narrow the focus to the issue of making individuals with ASD independent members of society
    introduce sign language as a mainstream means of communication.

  Have `History` focus on how IWAs have been marginalized socially or been socially dependent
    describe {the lack of understanding and poor diagnoses} as a part of that problem.
    introduce sign language as a solution.

This Changelog exists because I was not using GitHub. LOL.

  Yeah, I cleared the document, because the original text had too much clutter. I really have no clue how the other students do this. The size of the file is enough to make me run away.
  Also, the way the Veldman talks about the topic is way too extreme and energetic. I can't just optimistically shout my ideas at the reader. That's just not OK.
  I am also not going to focus on marginalization ;; that is just too extreme and opinionated.


*bro, why did I get so depresed all of a sudden?*

Why even bother writing a paper anyways? Its not like Im helping anyone.

The only thing I really should do (if anything at all) is just type this:
  Sign Language could be useful to children with ASD (CWAs). The people (let $A = those people) who help the CWAs should consider going through the following process:
    $A learns sign language
    $A uses some sign language when interacting with the CWA
    $A incorporates some sign language into ABA interventions / NBDI when interacting with the CWA
    $A tries to use reinforcement training,
      in order to motivate the CWA to learn some sign language as well.

  I split the document into multiple separate documents / files, in order to avoid stress form seeing too much work.
  I also decided to start my actual `rough draft` by writing an essay. The `essay` is mostly my uninterrupted thoughts, without any citations.

Break day (I really took a break from the research paper and did some programming).


31 March, 2023
I copied all of the google docs that were on my school account over to my personal account.

Now I can be sure that my aunt (and other people) will be able to actually view all of my files (since they are publicly available to `anyone with the link` to the google doc(s)).

I also cleaned up my bookmarks and fixed (standardized) many of the names on many of the google docs and bookmarks.
    I even improved my `download clipboard` bookmark.

  I actually worked on writing some of the paper, finally.
  I have decided to relax with the writing process and not stress over every possible imperfection that the teacher might be (technically) able to point out. I am going to assume that the teacher is not attentive enough, or that the teacher IS gracious enough, to allow me to make claims without proving them via citation.
    Other students try to avoid plagiarism, while I try to avoid coming up with my own ideas.
  
  I started by writing in the `Clarifications` section, because I just love to clarify things. Clarification is one of my greatest habits.
  
  I love writing down my thoughts and activities. It reduces **so much** stress!
    I should do this more often. GitHub has so many great ways of doing this.
    I wish there was a code editor that had a couple of features for this by default.
  
  Anyways, I went to the gym today, and my muscles are making me feel super drowsy. None of my muscles really hurt that much (I think that I am actually just tolerating the pain though).
  
  Maybe I really am striving for too much perfection with this paper. I changed my writing mentality at the beginning of the semester; I originally was absorbed in my own contention and wanted to outperform everyone else. Now I am going to just write the paper, without worrying about imperfections. I admit that I am not much greater than the other students.


2 April, 2023
I did a lot of writing work. I worked on the `History ASD`, `clarifications`, and `sign lang can help` sections.

I also added dozens and dozens of comments on the various Google Documents.


3 April, 2023
Fun fact:
  The name/title of a Google Doc can NOT be changed while doing offline editing.
  
  I just spent a bunch of time programming (like ~5 hours!).
  Oh how I love programming.
  I guess I will get to my paper tomorrow. Or maybe later tomorrow. I am really excited to have Jenet help me with it.
  Jenet was planning on helping me today, but she was busy in Grand Rapids and ended up running out of time.
    Hopefully we will be very productive tomorrow.

I sent Veldman and Stout an email, to see if Veldman read my paper & remind Veldman to read my paper.

I am hoping to finish the paper on the 10th or the 11th.


10 April, 2023
<Future Day>
I am hoping to finish the paper today.

On 10 April, 2033, I will create a final, version of the paper (version 3.0).

*Hahahah; that plan was never gonna work!*
