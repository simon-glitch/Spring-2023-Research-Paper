# Spring-2023-Research-Paper
This repository exists for the sole purpose of documenting my 2023 research paper.

I genuinely prefer GitHub because it has better version control than Google Docs.
I now see that GitHub is obviously better than Google Docs in every way, and that Google Docs just SUCKS.
I can't wait to have a VS Code setup for highlighting code to make my life even easier.

My goal here is to have better version control. I want to practice this skill.
