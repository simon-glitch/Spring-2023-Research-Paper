# Changes:
  * After my thesis, I had this relevant comment:
  * * `(This is discussed in more detail in the Sign Language Can Help section of this paper)`
  * * the fact that is stated in the comment can be inferred and is really quite obvious, so I decided to remove it.
  * * I removed `One should remember that` at the beginning of the `Conclusion` section, because it is also implied, and the reader would probably like to just jump into the conclusions.
  * Completed this citation `([1], page ?)` (in `Beyond ASD` section);

# Considerations
  * Should `ASD is a behaviorally defined neurological disorder` be in the Definition Summary? I guess it kinda fits in the Conclusion (since it can remind the reader about what they learned in the Def Sum, and the it also summarized the Def of ASD in just a few words).
  * As Grammarly has pointed out, I don't need too many transition words.
  * Fun Fact: Grammarly says that my paper is at a reading level or approximately 10th grade difficulty.

# Transition Checklist:
  > [Y] = Intro to Hist - L*
  > [Y] = Hist to Def Sum
  > [Y] = Def Sum to SL Can Help
  > [Y] = SL Can Help to Beyond ASD
  > [Y] = Beyond ASD to Clarifications
  > [Y] = **no transitions are needed to or from Christian Perspective, since it is irrelevant anyways**
  > [Y] = Clarifications to Conclusion
  * L* incdicates that a label needs to be removed
  * The transition which used to be {Transition from `Beyond ASD` to `Clarifications`} is now {Transition from `SL Can Help` to `Beyond ASD`}


# Footnotes to remove:
* `specific case of ASD (see footnote [^ยน]).`
