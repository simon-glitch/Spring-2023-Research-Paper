#I am STILL NOT DONE with this project!
**WOW!**


I am spending some time setting up the paper's HTML formatting.
I think I might add in a button that swap's the paper's monospace font for a serif or sans-serif font. I think I will use the new Domine font I discovered. It's a REALLY nice sans-serif.

Here is the link to the research paper (as of 1:52 AM, April 29, of 2023):
  https://simon-glitch.github.io/Projects/simons_research_paper/index.html

This link won't be getting changed, since I will update it like a "main" link,
I had a lot of fun setting this all up!

TODO list:
* The main goal for today (and for the paper), currently, should actually be to add actual sources that support my solution (`Sign Language Can Help`).
* The goal for today **still** is to focus on organizing and `compiling` the paper. The paper is almost done, and I want to be able to focus on those 2 important things.
* * When I finally get this paper done, I can finally begin to focus on other things, such as studying for AP Stats (assuming that I might get to take the AP Exam for AP Stats).
* 
* I added a short paragraph about the impact of face masks on Sign Language. Is it relevant? Ehh, kinda ~ barely, yeah!~
* Seriously (sewiously) though, I am gonna have fun today.
* 
* 
* I could only find 2 sources to support my claim:
* * \[36\] https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01531345 (spring.com; paywall)
* * \[37\] https://doi.org/10.1901%2Fjaba.1978.11-489 (PMC; from Wiley Online)
* 
* 
* consider replacing certain direct quotations with footnotes, because I honestly don't like direct quotations (I prefer my own specific voice and writing style);
* * I have 2 things in the clarifications that {I am considering for the act of moving them to the footnotes}. These writing
* * APD now feels like a footnote;
