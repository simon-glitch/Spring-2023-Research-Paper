#I am STILL NOT DONE with this project!
**WOW!**

====

2nd Hour (report):
  Don't tell her, but I am ***REALLY INTO*** Emonne! I always have been, and I think about her a lot when I am at school. Of course, I do quit thinking about people and school and stuff when I get home. Emonne, Julienne, and Joy aren't here today. I wrote the date (4/28/23) on the board; typically updating the date is Emonne's responsibility, but she seems to be absent.
Whole day:
  The Juniors are gone on retreat today; thus, Ms Veldman AND Mr Hoogstrate are also gone. The school sure does feel kinda empty.
3rd Hour:
  I think we are technically skipping class right now. We are in Room 22; we are usually in this room for AP Stats (3rd Hour), **but**:
  * we don't have a teacher with us,
  * and maybe we should be in study hall (in the Cafeteria instead).
  > I know that our school has a really weird rule: skipping class means that the student has to go to school on Saturday, as a punishment. The rule is really weird, considering that not coming to school simply results in the student being told to attend a detention (which is much less severe than being told to attend school on Saturday, obviously). I would never attend school on a Saturday, since that could really ruin my sleep schedule.
  > Anyways, these crazy students are throwing a volley ball around, relentlessly.

TODO list:
* The goal for today **still** is to focus on organizing and `compiling` the paper. The paper is almost done, and I want to be able to focus on those 2 important things.
* * When I finally get this paper done, I can finally begin to focus on other things, such as studying for AP Stats (assuming that I might get to take the AP Exam for AP Stats).
* 
* I added a short paragraph about the impact of face masks on Sign Language. Is it relevant? Ehh, kinda ~ barely, yeah!~
* Seriously (sewiously) though, I am gonna have fun today.
* 
* 
* 
* consider replacing certain direct quotations with footnotes, because I honestly don't like direct quotations (I prefer my own specific voice and writing style);
* * I have 2 things in the clarifications that {I am considering for the act of moving them to the footnotes}. These writing
* * APD now feels like a footnote;
* I removed this comment from the `Clarifications` section:
* * // Seems off topic, but I want to include this somewhere anyways:
* * However, the ASD expense is insignificant in comparison to other expenses in the medical field. For example, the funding that goes to producing, distributing & maintaining vaccinations is [RESEARCH].
